# Java Array Functions Project



This Java project processes arrays by taking user input, separating odd and even numbers, calculating differences between consecutive elements, and identifying the smallest difference index. It uses `ArrayLists` for dynamic storage and provides a structured approach to array manipulation.  

### **Key Features:**  
✔️ User input handling  
✔️ Odd-even number separation  
✔️ Difference calculation between elements  
✔️ Smallest difference index identification
